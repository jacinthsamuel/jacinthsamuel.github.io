<p>My opinion:</p>
<p>I normally do not have such a feeling about a ROM, but this ROM is just fantastic. I installed the vannila version and I am using it with microg. The signature spoofing feature is good to have. I am getting a battery of more than 2 days. It is the best battery life that I have gotten from my phone since I bought it 1 year ago. It is not feature packed, but has some nice little quirks that are useful. The ROM also has a gapps version if you cannot live without the google play service. Overall a fantastic ROM. Try it out.</p></li>

<li><p>TVS Gold Pro Keyboards</p>
<p>So I decided to go from membrane to mechanical keyboard after over 15 years of using just membrane keyboards. After a search of about 1 month, I finally decided to buy the TVS Gold Pro Keyboard.</p>
<p>Then the TVS Gold Pro keyboard arrived and it is just fantastic. I do not have the fatigue that I used to feel after a few minutes of typing on my previous Logitech membrane keyboard. Don't get me wrong. My Logitech Membrane Keyboard was actually pretty good. I have typed on far worse membrane keyboards. But the New TVS mechanical keyboard was just on a completely different level. It is just fantastic.I really love the keyboard.</p>
<p>Just one gripe that I have about this keyboard is that the backspacekey is small. On all the keyboards that I or my family has personally owned the backspace key has always been big and I got used to it right from when I was 8 years old and that would be 17 years ago. So I found it very uncomfortable at the beginning and I wish the key was bigger, but it does not bother me nowas much as it did before and it has jsut been two days since I got this keyboard. Maybe large backspace keys were overrated after all.</p>
<p>Anyway a wonderful. if you are looking to make the switch from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical keyboard, this could be a wonderful gateway as it is not expensive. Mine cost just 3099 rupees.</p></li>
